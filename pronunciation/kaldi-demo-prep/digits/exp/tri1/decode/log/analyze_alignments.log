The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 13.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 7.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (10,104.7,11)
